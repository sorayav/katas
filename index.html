  <!-- Challenge 1: 
    Description:
    Polycarpus works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.

    Let's assume that a song consists of some number of words (that don't contain WUB). To make the dubstep remix of this song, Polycarpus inserts a certain number of words "WUB" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including "WUB", in one string and plays the song at the club.

    For example, a song with words "I AM X" can transform into a dubstep remix as "WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX" and cannot transform into "WUBWUBIAMWUBX".

    Recently, Jonny has heard Polycarpus's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Polycarpus remixed. Help Jonny restore the original song.

    Input
    The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters

    Output
    Return the words of the initial song that Polycarpus used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space. -->
  

    <!-- Challenge 2:
    In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

    Example:

    makeNegative(1); // return -1
    makeNegative(-5); // return -5
    makeNegative(0); // return 0
    makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
    Notes:

    The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
    Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense. -->

    <!-- Challenge 3:
    
    Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

    For example:

    persistence(39) === 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                          // and 4 has only one digit

    persistence(999) === 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                           // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

    persistence(4) === 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number -->

    <!-- Challenge 4:
    ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

    If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

    eg:

    validatePIN("1234") === true
    validatePIN("12345") === false
    validatePIN("a234") === false -->
